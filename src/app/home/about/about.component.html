          Interacting with JSON data in an application involves a few core
          processes. First, JSON data can be fetched from an API using methods
          like <b>fetch()</b> or <b>axios</b>, often requiring headers to be
          customized for authentication or content type. Once headers are set,
          the payload data that is sent with the request can also be modified,
          allowing developers to define what information the API should receive.
          Complete modification of JSON data involves altering keys and values
          within the JSON structure to meet specific needs. Finally, handling
          the response involves parsing the JSON to extract meaningful data,
          which can then be used within the applicationâ€™s interface or for
          further processing.
